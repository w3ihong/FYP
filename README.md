For code samples/testing , create your own local branch
The test branch is for reference
Work should be done on the master branch, any confirmed code will be subseqently pulled into the main branch(deployed)

- any reuseable components goes under components 
- images etc goes under public
- follow the page structure, if anything about the page structure is wrong pls let me know, i unfortuantely dont know everything.
- for all pages under admin and protected, a check should be done first before letting the user acces the page, else redirect the user to login(see test branch for example)
- make compoenents as resuableas posbbile and put them under components, in react, components can take in parameters (e.g. the same button and take in a path variable, so that clickng the same button takes the suer to different pages)
- components unique to the page can be put in the same folder as the page itself
- check tools and links(google drive) for additional documentaiton and information
